## Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an aspiring programmer with expertise in C++, Lua, Rust, and a bit of reverse engineering. I am constantly coding, trying to perfect my skills.

## Programming Experience
- **C++**: I have been coding in C++ for 3 years, working on various software, from cheat-development to software-protection.
- **Lua**: Over the course of 4 years, I have gained more experience in Lua, building on from past experience (shown below), and utilized it for scripting and extending software functionality.
- **LuaU**: Scripter and developer on Roblox for the past 6 years. I have been creating games using the Roblox engine, and creating scripts on Roblox.
- **Rust**: Recently, I have been enjoying Rust for the past 4 months, using it in smaller projects for its readability and usability. 
- **Go**: Used it for the past month, and it has quickly became one of my favorite language due to how easy and straightforward it is. 
- **PY**: I have been coding in Python for around 4 years. It is one of my first languages. It taught me many core principles, although I don't like the syntax.
- **JS/TS**: I am using it frequently in web-development and discord bots. I have 4 years of experience in this language. It's not one of my favorites.
- **Java**: Pretty fun. I worked with it for a month, writing a Minecraft plugin for use in my friend-only server. 
- **C**: I've only worked with C for a short time in order to experiment with kernel drivers, and it wasn't bad at all.

## Hobbies and Interests

In addition to programming, I indulge in the world of reverse engineering as a hobby. I like to inspect how progams work, while also document their behavior. 

I'm constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to improve my skills.

## GitHub Projects

From cheating-software, reverse engineering experiments, to web-development, I enjoy exploring many topics.

I'm always free to collaborate, learn, and share knowledge with fellow developers. If you're interested in creating projects, or connecting professionally, feel free to contact me through Discord!
