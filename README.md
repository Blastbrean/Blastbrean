## Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an aspiring programmer with expertise in **C+**+, **Lua/LuaU**, **Rust**, and a bit of **reverse engineering**. I am constantly coding, trying to **perfect** my skills.

## Programming Experience
- **C++**: I have been coding in C++ since `Feb 21st, 2020`, working on various software, from cheat development to software protection.

- **Lua/LuaU**: Scripter and developer on Roblox since `March 18th, 2016`. I have been creating games using the Roblox engine, and creating scripts on Roblox. I've used Lua before the LuaU change and on different platforms. It was mostly to build on from experience and extend software functionaliy. 

- **Rust**: I have been enjoying Rust as a whole. I started using this language at `July 5th, 2023`, and I am using it in various projects for its readability and usability. 

- **Go**: I've been using it for a huge project, which started in `September 1st, 2023`, and it has quickly became one of my favorite language due to how easy and straightforward it is. 

- **Python**: I have been coding in Python for 4+ years. I started during `January 4th, 2020` when we had to quaratine. It is one of my first languages. It taught me many core principles, although I don't like the syntax. My experience using it was simply to learn from it.

- **JS/TS**: I am using it frequently in web-development and discord bots. I have been working with this language since `March 9th, 2020`. It's not one of my favorites, but it does it's job well and is usually hassle free.

- **Java**: Pretty fun. I worked with it for around a month (from `June 10th, 2020` to `July 1st, 2020`) in order to write Minecraft plugin(s) for use in my friend-only server. I'm confident I could write more advanced plugins with more time spent!

- **C**: I've only worked with C for a week in order to experiment with kernel drivers. It wasn't a bad experience but how I ran and tested my kernel drivers could be improved massively. I should have also done more research myself.

## Hobbies and Interests

In addition to programming, I love to indulge in the world of reverse engineering as a hobby. I like to inspect how progams work, while also document their behavior. 

I'm constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to improve my skills.

## GitHub Projects

From cheating-software, reverse engineering experiments, to web-development, I enjoy exploring many topics.

I'm always free to collaborate, learn, and share knowledge with fellow developers. If you're interested in creating projects, or connecting professionally, feel free to contact me through Discord!
