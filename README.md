## Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an aspiring programmer with expertise in C++, Lua, Rust, and a bit of reverse engineering. I am constantly coding, trying to perfect my skills.

## Programming Experience
- **C++**: I have been coding in C++ for 4 years, working on various software, from cheat-development to software-protection.
- **Lua**: Over the course of 6 years, I have gained extensive experience in Lua, utilizing it for scripting and extending software functionality.
- **Rust**: Recently, I have been enjoying Rust for the past 4 months, using it in smaller projects for its readability and usability.

## Minor Programming Experience
- **PY**: I have been coding in Python for around 4 years. I have used it working with IDAPython and D.PY bots!
- **JS/TS**: I have been coding in JS/TS for 3 years. I have used it while working with MERN projects and D.JS bots!
- **Java**: Worked with it for a month, writing a Minecraft plugin for use in my friend-only server.
- **C**: Used C shortly while working with Kernel Drivers.

## Hobbies and Interests

In addition to programming, I indulge in the world of reverse engineering as a hobby. I like to inspect how progams work, while also document their behavior. 

I'm constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to improve my skills.

## GitHub Projects

From cheating-software, reverse engineering experiments, to web-development, I enjoy exploring many topics.
